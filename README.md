# sudoku-game-online

Hey! This project is a website built with MERN stack and hosted on Heroku, and it is a simple Sudoku site, </br>
where you can solve Suodokus of different difficulties and have fun with it!

The sudokus are generated on server-side through a simple backtracking algorithm, which then also makes sure the deleted numbers keep the solution unique!
THis project was inspired by https://github.com/trananhtuat/javascript-sudoku , an awesome project you should check out, </br>
from which I borrowed some parts of its awesome website styling.
Check out my deployed version at https://sudoku-game-online.herokuapp.com/ , and have fun!
